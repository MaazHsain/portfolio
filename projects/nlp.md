This project involves the implementation of both statistical and modern deep learning models to classify resumes. Utilizing Decision Trees, Random Forests, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, alongside word embeddings with Word2Vec, the project aims to accurately categorize resumes into predefined job roles. By comparing the performance of these diverse models, the project demonstrates the strengths and applicability of each approach in the context of natural language processing and resume classification.
