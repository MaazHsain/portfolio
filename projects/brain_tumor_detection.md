In this project, I developed a system for detecting brain tumors from MRI scans using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and U-Net models. The system effectively identifies and segments tumor regions, providing high accuracy and recall rates. Leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, the model processes MRI images to assist in early diagnosis and treatment planning. The results demonstrate significant promise for improving medical image analysis and aiding healthcare professionals in clinical settings.
