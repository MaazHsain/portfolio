The primary focus of the project revolved around answering the following questions:
1. Which industries have the most companies?

3. Which companies have the top ratings, and which industries do they represent?  
4. Where does my target industry stand among others in terms of performance?  
5. Are there industries with consistently poor company ratings?  
6. For every industry, how many companies have a rating of 4 or above?  

These questions guided the analysis and helped break down the industry landscape into actionable insights.
